    title: "The Sacred Tradition of Shea Butter",
    introduction: "For over 3,000 years, the women of West Africa have perfected the art of shea butter creation, transforming the nuts of the sacred karite tree into liquid gold that heals, protects, and beautifies. This ancient wisdom, passed down through generations of mothers to daughters, represents more than skincareâ€”it embodies community, tradition, and the celebration of natural beauty.",
    origins: "In the villages of Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Mali, the shea tree is revered as the 'Tree of Life.' Women gather beneath its branches to share stories while hand-processing the nuts using traditional methods unchanged for millennia. The process itself is a meditation, a celebration of feminine wisdom, and a connection to ancestral knowledge.",
    modernApplication: "At Serenity Spa Kenya, we honor this sacred tradition by sourcing our shea butter directly from women's cooperatives in West Africa, ensuring fair trade practices while preserving authentic preparation methods. Our therapists have trained with traditional healers to understand not just the application, but the spiritual significance of this transformative ritual.",
